# scoutling — instructions for agents working on this repo

Read, in this order, before changing anything:

1. `DESIGN.md` — the full design: architecture, config layers, tools, budget, citation contract,
   CLI contract, eval, phasing (§13 is the work plan), future ideas, decisions log.
2. `CONTEXT.md` — the glossary. Use its terms exactly (Step not turn, Scope not workspace,
   Source vs Citation, Provider not backend). When you need a new term, add it there via the
   `domain-modeling` skill.
3. `docs/adr/*.md` — four decisions that must not be "fixed": CLI not MCP; read-only by
   absence of capability (never add a write tool or `--allow-edit`); provider-agnostic with no
   default model; `@vscode/ripgrep`, never system `rg`.

## Rules

- **Tests first.** New behaviour → failing test → implementation → green. Bug → regression test
  that fails on the bug. All tests are hermetic: mock the model via `ai/test`; never require a
  live provider in `pnpm test`. Live checks are a separate `pnpm smoke` script.
- **Read-only is structural.** No file in `src/` imports a filesystem write API. `no-write` test
  is a permanent gate.
- **Agent-facing CLI ergonomics** follow the `axi` skill: structured one-line JSON errors with
  codes on stderr, definitive empty states, next-step hints, no interactive prompts, exit codes
  per DESIGN.md §9.
- **AI SDK is v7** (`ai@^7`, `@ai-sdk/openai-compatible@^3`). Use the `ai-sdk` skill for the
  API; do not copy v5 patterns from elsewhere.
- **Portability is the product.** Nothing in this repo may assume a particular machine, gateway,
  model alias or installed binary. If a default would only be right on one machine, it is not a
  default — it is a config-file example.
- **Packaging** follows the `ts-library` skill: ESM, single bundled entry, `bin` → `scoutling`,
  Node ≥ 20, `npm publish --provenance` from CI on tags.
- Commit small and often on `main` with conventional-ish messages; push after each green phase.

## Local dev

- Reference machine runs LM Studio on `http://localhost:1234/v1`; verified model ids for smoke
  tests: `qwen/qwen3-coder-next` (fast), `qwen/qwen3-next-80b`, `qwen/qwen3.8-27b`,
  `qwen/qwen3.6-35b-a3b`. Put your own in `scoutling.config.local.json` (gitignored).
- `pnpm` is the package manager.
